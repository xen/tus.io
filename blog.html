    <div class="post-content">
  <p>Today, we are thrilled to announce the v1.0.0 release of our <a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd">tusd project</a>, the official reference implementation for the tus protocol. Don’t let yourself be fooled by the version number, tusd has been production-ready and battle-tested for many years already.</p>

<p>This release ships with a few exciting new features but most of the changes were necessary to clean up technical debt which accumulated  over the last four years. We try to avoid frequent breaking changes in tusd to reduce the impact of dependency upgrades on your project. However, this debt also prevented us from adding new highly-requested features and tusd 1.0 is now able to deliver those.</p>

<p>A detailed list of all relevant changes in the 1.0 release can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release notes</a> where you are also able to download prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>

<p>Despite the number of breaking changes, I want to emphasize that <strong>no changes to your tus clients</strong> are necessary. All breaking changes are server-facing only and tusd offers the same tus HTTP interface as before. This was an important guarantee for us as we want to make it easy for you to upgrade tusd without worrying about older clients.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone again who helped to make this release happen! If you also want to contribute, you can find our open source code at <a href="https://github.com/tus">GitHub</a>. If you don’t know where to start or have other questions, feel free to <a href="/support.html">contact us</a>!</p>

  <p>A bit less than two months ago, we released <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/releases/tag/v1.6.0">version 1.6.0</a> of <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/">tus-js-client</a>, our open source tus implementation for JavaScript environments. Usually, we don’t write a blog post about a specific release, but this one is very special to us for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Version 1.6.0 contains three very exiting new features, and</li>
  <li>All of the three features were contributed by members of our community.</li>
</ol>

<p>To raise awareness about those new additions, as well as to thank the contributors for their help, I decided to write a short blog post about them.</p>

<p>We had a fun month as we learned that <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/man/git-lfs-config.5.ronn#transfer-upload--download-settings">Git LFS supports our protocol for transmitting large files</a>, and Clouflare uses it to power the uploading component of their <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-streams/">new streaming product</a>. The ‘tus’ community on GitHub continues to thrive and we’re seeing issues raised and addressed on a daily basis. You guys are awesome!</p>

  <p>Yes, oddly enough, this seems to be the case! A while ago, we noticed something really interesting on tus.io, our open protocol for resumable uploads: a <a href="/implementations.html#comment-2903776646">comment</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/Orajo">Jaroslaw Wasilewski</a> mentioned that tus was being used to support firefighting rescue operations. Now that is exciting news!</p>

<p>While we did set out to make the world a slightly better place by making uploading more reliable for everyone, this is certainly not what we had in mind. We were very interested to learn more about this, so we invited Jaroslaw to sit down with us for a virtual cup of coffee and asked him to tell us a little more about the system they have developed – and how they are using tus for it.</p>

  <p>With their Simple Storage System (S3), Amazon Web Services has built one of the major providers of cloud storage for applications ranging from small side projects to enterprise systems. Since the introduction of flexible storage back-ends for the official <a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd">tusd</a> server, an integration with S3 has been a much desired feature by our users. We are happy to announce that we are now able to <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tus/tusd/s3store">deliver</a> on this request. During the time it took to create this, we had to deal with various peculiarities of Amazon’s service and were able to gain a lot of experience. In this post, we want to focus on the downsides of building a tus server on top of S3 and share some of our recently acquired knowledge with you.</p>

  <p>After releasing our first draft a few weeks ago, we received an incredible
amount of feedback and suggestions. Based on this feedback as well as
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2013AprJun/0155.html">discussing</a>
the problems with the <a href="http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/wiki">IETF HTTPbis Working Group</a>, we identified a few
key issues with <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/blob/v0.1/README.md">v0.1</a> of the
protocol:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PUT</code> requests are not appropriate for transferring partial resources</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Content-Range</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Range</code> headers are not meant for resuming an

  <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> We are happy to announce version 0.1 of the 
<a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">tus resumable upload protocol</a> and are interested in your
feedback!</p>

<p>With mobile devices becoming the dominant source of user generated media files,
reliable file uploading through unreliable mobile networks has become an
important issue for anybody interested in content acquisition.</p>

<p>Reliability here means the ability to detect network errors, and resuming an
upload without having to start from the beginning. In many scenarios this can
mean the difference between a file reaching your application, or the user
giving up in frustration.</p>
